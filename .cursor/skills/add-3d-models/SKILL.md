description: Add 3D models (.glb/.gltf) to a Decentraland scene using GltfContainer. Covers loading, positioning, scaling, colliders, parenting, and browsing 2,700+ free assets from the Creator Hub catalog and 991 CC0 models. Use when the user wants to add models, import GLB files, find free 3D assets, or set up model colliders. Do NOT use for materials/textures (see advanced-rendering) or model animations (see animations-tweens).

# Adding 3D Models to Decentraland Scenes

## Loading a 3D Model

Use `GltfContainer` to load `.glb` or `.gltf` files:

```typescript
import { engine, Transform, GltfContainer } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { Vector3, Quaternion } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

const model = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(model, {
  position: Vector3.create(8, 0, 8),
  rotation: Quaternion.fromEulerDegrees(0, 0, 0),
  scale: Vector3.create(1, 1, 1)
})
GltfContainer.create(model, {
  src: 'models/myModel.glb'
})
```

## File Organization

Place model files in a `models/` directory at the project root:
```
project/
├── models/
│   ├── building.glb
│   ├── tree.glb
│   └── furniture/
│       ├── chair.glb
│       └── table.glb
├── src/
│   └── index.ts
└── scene.json
```

## Colliders

### Using Model's Built-in Colliders
Models exported with collision meshes work automatically. Set the collision mask:
```typescript
GltfContainer.create(model, {
  src: 'models/building.glb',
  visibleMeshesCollisionMask: ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS | ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER,
  invisibleMeshesCollisionMask: ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS
})
```

### Adding Simple Colliders
For basic shapes, add `MeshCollider`:
```typescript
import { MeshCollider } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
MeshCollider.setBox(model) // Box collider
MeshCollider.setSphere(model) // Sphere collider
```

## Common Model Operations

### Scaling
```typescript
Transform.create(model, {
  position: Vector3.create(8, 0, 8),
  scale: Vector3.create(2, 2, 2) // 2x size
})
```

### Rotation
```typescript
Transform.create(model, {
  position: Vector3.create(8, 0, 8),
  rotation: Quaternion.fromEulerDegrees(0, 90, 0) // Rotate 90° on Y axis
})
```

### Parenting (Attach to Another Entity)
```typescript
const parent = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(parent, { position: Vector3.create(8, 0, 8) })

const child = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(child, {
  position: Vector3.create(0, 2, 0), // 2m above parent
  parent: parent
})
GltfContainer.create(child, { src: 'models/hat.glb' })
```

## Free 3D Models

Always check both asset catalogs before suggesting the user create or find their own models.

### Creator Hub Asset Packs (2,700+ models)

Read `{baseDir}/../../context/asset-packs-catalog.md` for official Decentraland models across 12 themed packs (Cyberpunk, Fantasy, Gallery, Sci-fi, Western, Pirates, etc.) with furniture, structures, decorations, nature, and more.

To use a Creator Hub model:
```bash
# Download from catalog
mkdir -p models
curl -o models/arcade_machine.glb "https://builder-items.decentraland.org/contents/bafybei..."
```
```typescript
// Reference in code — must be a local file path
GltfContainer.create(entity, { src: 'models/arcade_machine.glb' })
```

### Open Source CC0 Models (991 models)

Read `{baseDir}/../../context/open-source-3d-assets.md` for free CC0-licensed models from Polygonal Mind, organized by 18 themed collections (MomusPark, Medieval Fair, Cyberpunk, Sci-fi, etc.) with direct GitHub download URLs.

```bash
curl -o models/tree.glb "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToxSam/cc0-models-Polygonal-Mind/main/projects/MomusPark/Tree_01_Art.glb"
```

### How to suggest models

1. Read both catalog files
2. Search for models matching the user's description/theme
3. Suggest specific models with download commands
4. Download selected models into the scene's `models/` directory
5. Reference them in code with local paths

> **Important**: `GltfContainer` only works with **local files**. Never use external URLs for the model `src` field. Always download models into `models/` first.

### Checking Model Load State

Use `GltfContainerLoadingState` to check if a model has finished loading:

```typescript
import { GltfContainer, GltfContainerLoadingState, LoadingState } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

engine.addSystem(() => {
  const state = GltfContainerLoadingState.getOrNull(modelEntity)
  if (state && state.currentState === LoadingState.FINISHED) {
    console.log('Model loaded successfully')
  } else if (state && state.currentState === LoadingState.FINISHED_WITH_ERROR) {
    console.log('Model failed to load')
  }
})
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Model not visible | Wrong file path | Verify the file exists at the exact path relative to project root (e.g., `models/myModel.glb`) |
| Model not visible | Position outside scene boundaries | Check Transform position is within 0-16 per parcel. Center of 1-parcel scene is (8, 0, 8) |
| Model not visible | Scale is 0 or very small | Check `Transform.scale` — default is (1,1,1). Try larger values if model was exported very small |
| Model not visible | Behind the camera | Move the avatar or rotate to look in the model's direction |
| Model loads but looks wrong | Y-up vs Z-up mismatch | Decentraland uses Y-up. Re-export from Blender with "Y Up" checked |
| "FINISHED_WITH_ERROR" load state | Corrupted or unsupported .glb | Re-export the model. Use `.glb` (binary GLTF) format. Ensure no unsupported extensions |
| Clicking model does nothing | Missing collider | Add `visibleMeshesCollisionMask: ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER` to `GltfContainer` or add `MeshCollider` |

> **Need animations from your model?** See the **animations-tweens** skill for playing GLTF animation clips with Animator.

## Model Best Practices

- Keep models under 50MB per file for good loading times
- Use `.glb` format (binary GLTF) — smaller than `.gltf`
- Optimize triangle count: aim for under 1,500 triangles per model for small props
- Use texture atlases when possible to reduce draw calls
- Models with embedded animations can be played with the `Animator` component
- Test model orientation — Decentraland uses Y-up coordinate system
- Materials in models should use PBR (physically-based rendering) for best results
